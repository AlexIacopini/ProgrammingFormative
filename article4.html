		   		<p>Artificial intelligence is the process by which a computer can perceive its environment, and through specific instructions given by a human it can maximize its chance of achieving its goals. By feeding computers abstractions of real life problems, they can take in to account all properties of the ‘universe’ that has been programmed for them, and follow instructions to eventually spit out solutions. Naturally, AI has hundreds of applications that have been developed or are still in development in areas like finance, medicine and transportation: all in the aim to refine and automatize.</p>

				<h4><b><i>Aviation</i></b></h4>
				<img src="https://recast.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/legacy_executive_aircraft_cockpit.jpg" class="rounded float-right" style="width:200px;height:133px">
				<p>Certain air forces around the world are beginning to utilise AI in expert systems: a piece of artificial intelligence that focuses in decision making and is similar to that of a human expert. These allow for more advanced combat and training simulators, mission management aids and support and tactics systems.</p>
				<p>Simulators are using AI to process the data from simulated flights, as well as process things like aircraft warfare in order to calculate best success scenarios in certain situations that might take place. They  can read information about the aircrafts placement, size and speed in order to calculate which strategy may be best.</p>
				<p>Aircraft also use AI to measure performance and create a fault diagnosis system. This is designed to replace human specialist workers and allow humans to directly communicate with the system to help avoid mistakes and miscalculations before or during flights, so that they can be dealt with as safely and quickly as possible. AI can read directly from specific sensors over the aircraft and interpret data used to determine things like structural integrity of aircraft.</p>
				<p>AI is also used in speech recognition software for planes, allowing air traffic controllers to give directions to artificial pilots with simple keywords. The AI must first be ‘trained’, which means the use of neural networks and constant interaction. This will help to make sure the speech recognition acts correctly and promptly every time</p>
				<p>It also has other uses in the development of aircraft. It can help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This allows designers to focus more on the design itself rather than the process. It also means the designer does not need to focus on software tools, as this is all handled by the computer.</p>
				<p>Other AI systems are being used for emergency situations, such as during the event of damaged aircraft components. These systems could enable damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing site is reached. It does this by compensating for damaged components with whatever undamaged components are available.</p>
				<p>With all of these systems together the aviation industry benefit greatly. With improvements to development, inflight control, safety, self-diagnosis and performance all thanks to artificial intelligence.</p>

				<h4><b><i>Medicine</i></b></h4>
				<img src="https://1712507217.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/deep-genomics.jpg" class="rounded float-right" style="width:200px;height:133px">
				<p>AI could have a big effect on hospitals and medicine. For example, artificial intelligence neural networks, which aim to build a kind of ‘thinking’ system similar to that of a human brain, are used as clinical decision support systems. These help doctors carry out medical diagnosis so that the best course of action for a patient may be calculated, taking into account health observations and knowledge</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Computer-aided interpretation of medical images. Such systems help scan digital images, e.g. from computed tomography such as an x-ray, for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases. A typical application is the detection of a tumour</li>
				<li>Heart sound analysis - Heart auscultation (the interpretation by a physician of heart sounds) is a fundamental yet difficult skill to acquire. AI in computers can help to recognise the pattern of heart sounds and demonstrate its utility in identifying features useful in diagnosis.</li>
				<li>Drug creation - Developing pharmaceuticals through clinical trials take sometimes more than a decade and can be extremely expensive. Speeding this up and making more cost-effective ways of trialling drugs would have an enormous effect on today’s healthcare and how innovations reach everyday medicine.</li>
				<li>Medical data records – A prevalent application of artificial intelligence in healthcare is data management. Collecting it, storing it, and tracing its lineage – it will be a huge step in revolutionising the existing healthcare systems.</li>
				<li>Precision Medicine - Artificial intelligence will have a huge impact on genetics as well. AI can be used in identifying patterns in huge data sets of genetic information and medical records, looking for mutations and linkages to disease. New generations of computational technologies are being developed that can tell doctors what will happen within a cell when DNA is altered by genetic variation, whether natural or therapeutic.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4><b><i>Education</i></b></h4>
				<img src="https://business-reporter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ThinkstockPhotos-817293924.jpg" class="rounded float-right" style="width:200px;height:133px;">
				<p>AI has also started to have a presence in teaching and education. Some companies are beginning to create robots aiming to help teach subjects to children, and the use of artificial intelligence helps ease the work load for humans as well as create ways of teaching more efficiently. They are a good way to complement teachers with teaching basic necessities.</p>
				<p>Other tutoring devices have been created for area specific subjects using intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). These can be used anywhere ranging from teaching technicians diagnose electrical systems to training people in armies and navies.</p>
				<p>Advances in the ability for computer to process natural language thanks to artificial intelligence allow for automatic marking of exams and assignments, as well as outputting a data driven understanding of specific students’ needs. These are beginning to be especially popular for online courses as large data sets of students’ work can be marked quickly and effectively.</p>
				<p>Future students have been suggested the possibility of an ‘AI companion’ that will be able to help students individually rather than working for schools themselves. These would be useful for tracking a particular student’s performance over many years and analysing their strengths and weaknesses. In combination with direct teaching from  AI, it could help students throughout their education by AI personalising their teaching to counter their weaknesses. These personal AI companions could even be useful for students generating their CVs.</p>
				<p>AI will also work in identifying classroom weaknesses. For instance, AI will identify when groups of students miss certain questions letting the teacher know when material needs to be retaught. In this way, AI will also hold teachers accountable and strengthen best teaching practices.</p>
				<p>While artificial intelligence will not replace teachers altogether, it is possible that it will reshape the way teachers teach and students learn.</p>
