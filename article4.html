		   		<p>Artificial intelligence is the process by which a computer can perceive its environment, and through specific instructions given by a human it can maximize its chance of achieving its goals. By feeding computers abstractions of real life problems, they can take in to account all properties of the ‘universe’ that has been programmed for them, and follow instructions to eventually spit out solutions. Naturally, AI has hundreds of applications that have been developed or are still in development in areas like finance, medicine and transportation: all in the aim to refine and automatize.</p>

				<p>Certain air forces around the world are beginning to utilise AI in expert systems: a piece of artificial intelligence that focuses in decision making and is similar to that of a human expert. These allow for more advanced combat and training simulators, mission management aids and support and tactics systems.</p>
				<p>Simulators are using AI to process the data from simulated flights, as well as process things like aircraft warfare in order to calculate best success scenarios in certain situations that might take place. They  can read information about the aircrafts placement, size and speed in order to calculate which strategy may be best.</p>
				<p>Aircraft also use AI to measure performance and create a fault diagnosis system. This is designed to replace human specialist workers and allow humans to directly communicate with the system to help avoid mistakes and miscalculations before or during flights, so that they can be dealt with as safely and quickly as possible. AI can read directly from specific sensors over the aircraft and interpret data used to determine things like structural integrity of aircraft.</p>
				<p>AI is also used in speech recognition software for planes, allowing air traffic controllers to give directions to artificial pilots with simple keywords. The AI must first be ‘trained’, which means the use of neural networks and constant interaction. This will help to make sure the speech recognition acts correctly and promptly every time</p>
				<p>It also has other uses in the development of aircraft. It can help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This allows designers to focus more on the design itself rather than the process. It also means the designer does not need to focus on software tools, as this is all handled by the computer.</p>
				<p>Other AI systems are being used for emergency situations, such as during the event of damaged aircraft components. These systems could enable damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing site is reached. It does this by compensating for damaged components with whatever undamaged components are available.</p>
				<p>With all of these systems together the aviation industry benefit greatly. With improvements to development, inflight control, safety, self-diagnosis and performance all thanks to artificial intelligence.</p>
