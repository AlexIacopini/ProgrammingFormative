    <h1>Study while playing games.</h1>

    <h3>Exercising Your Brain With Video Games</h3>
	<p>To start, recent studies completed by several noted research and scientific organizations have proven that playing video games could help improve the quality of life for the disabled and mentally ill.

The main study, conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Charité University Medicine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus in Berlin, Germany, found that playing video increases grey matter (basically, the size of your brain) and helps refine learned and hardwired skills.</p>

	<p>The study also reinforces the claim that, like exercise, playing games for as little as 30 minutes a day, can improve your life.</p>
	
    <h3>How Different Parts of the Brain Are Impacted by Video Games</h3>
	<p>The <i> prefrontal cortex</i> is the part of the brain responsible for decision making, social behavior, personality, and cognitive planning. It makes sense, then, that this area of the brain is affected by playing Super Mario 64, a game which requires gamers to plan ahead and contemplate how to use and interact with objects in a virtual world.</p>
	<p>The<i> right hippocampus</i> plays an important role in how we process and consolidate information, including short-term and long-term memory. Scientists saw growth here too, caused by players using this part of the brain to navigate Mario’s world.</p>
	<p>Finally, the<i> cerebellum</i> was also affected—it’s the part of the brain that controls fine motor skills or muscular activity. Again, no surprise that it grew as well, since this part of the brain helps you quickly assess and respond to things happening around you—in this case, using a gamepad to move Mario at a moment’s notice, or to press the “jump” button at just the right time.</p>
	<p>As you might imagine, the results were more pronounced in those gamers who truly invested themselves in the gaming, and had a strong desire to beat the game or figure out the difficulties of a certain level.</p>

    <h3>PLAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE</h3>
