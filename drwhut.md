# 1. Interest of content

* Article 1 looks interesting, and goes in-depth. Just ashamed you didn't mention terminators :(
* Article 2 looks ok, those look like some fancy words.
* Article 3 looks brilliant, lots of detail. No complaints.
* Article 4 looks detailed, it's just hard to read.

Not bad in terms of content!

One thing I wanted to mention is that none of you linked anything, so if you said things like "studies showed", what studies???

# 2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation

* The index page looks clean, good use of grids!
* Article 1 looks great, I like the indentation and the section with the 3 columns! Also, Frankenstein's monster is always a win in my book.
* Article 2 looks ok, nothing fancy was used. No lists either.
* Article 3 looks nice, I like the placement of images, and the word wrap around the images looks good. Also, LISTS!
* Article 4 looks good, my only nit-pick is that the 3 columns go on for a little too long down the page, and you have bullet points only on the 2nd column.
* The navbar differs on some pages.

Overall, the website looks good!

# 3. Quality of written presentation

* Article 1 looks good, a couple of spelling errors (Scrutinise, Behaviours, Industrialised), I like the headers and section names. There's also a rogue '$'.
* Article 2 has a couple of spelling errors (Organisations, Behaviour), the last header looks a bit off with it being capitalised. Also, full stop missing at the end.
* Article 3 has one spelling error (Behaviour), other than that, no complaints.
* Article 4 has a couple of spelling errors (Automate, Trailing), a few places where there should be full stops.

# 4. Validity of HTML

* The index page has 8 errors.
* Article 1 has 53 HTML errors.
* Article 2 has 3 HTML errors.
* Article 3 has 7 HTML errors.
* Article 4 has 6 HTML errors.

This makes a total of 77 HTML errors... impressive!

# 5. Evidence of collaboration

* None of you forked the repository.
* No branches were used except for the master branch, it looks like...
* Only one pull request was made, and it hasn't been merged in yet.
* No issued were opened.
* Looking at the commits, it looks like you worked alone on your articles.
